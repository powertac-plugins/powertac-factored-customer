Description:
This plugin contains a "Factored Behaviors" statistical model of customer populations 
with consumption and/or production capacities. Behaviors such as tariff-utility, 
tariff-switching-inertia and elasticity-of-capacity can be specified directly using 
probability distributions, or alternately, they can be computed by the model using 
specified factors which underlie those behaviors.
